# Welcome to SUB's blog

This is my personal space where I want to publish some interesting aspects of my research and work as a Data Scientist.
Many times I used to struggle a lot when I'm facing a problem, and once it's solved, it just goes away, and with that the opportunity to communicate to someone else who maybe is going to the same path. That's going to be the spirit of this space.
